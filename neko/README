XCB TODO
--------
* needs testing on Linux, x86, <32 
  * XPutImage does all sorts of image conversion, required for
    making the 1Ll bitmaps compatible with the display.
    I only supported (1Ll --> 4Mm)
  * Move such support to xcb-image
* -root needs testing (Mac X is rootless)
* DEBUG not supported
* -geometry not supported
* WM hints, -iconic not supported (don't like the util interfaces)

XCB ENHANCEMENTS
----------------
* autoconf
* too many globals! refactor
* no X resource cleanup. OK?
* convert to use threading
  * multi-neko!
=======================

This is XNeko.
I have added color and root capability to this app.
I had nothing to do with anything except these modifications.
Don't look at the code.
